\title{
Maximum likelihood fit of the OU environmental model of trait evolution
}
\description{
Fits Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model of trait evolution for which the optimum depends on an environmental function, or more generally a time varying function.
}
\usage{

fit_t_env_ou(phylo, data, env_data, error=NULL, model,
          method="Nelder-Mead", control=list(maxit=20000), ...)
          
}
\arguments{
  \item{phylo}{
An object of class 'phylo' (see ape documentation)
}
  \item{data}{
A named vector of phenotypic trait values.
}
  \item{env_data}{
Environmental data, given as a time continuous function (see, e.g. splinefun) or a data frame with two columns. The first column is time, the second column is the environmental data (temperature for instance).
}
  \item{error}{
A named vector with standard errors (SE) of trait values for each species (with names matching \code{"phylo$tip.label"}). The default is NULL, in this case potential error is ignored in the fit. If set to NA, the SE is estimated from the data (to be used when there are no error measurements, a nuisance parameter is estimated). Note: When standard errors are provided, a nuisance parameter is also estimated.
}

 \item{model}{
 A user defined model. If not provided, a default model is used (see details)
 }

  \item{method}{
Methods used by the optimization routine (see ?optim for details).
}
  \item{control}{
Max. bound for the number of iteration of the optimizer; other options can be fixed on the list (see ?optim). 
}

\item{...}{
Arguments to be passed to the function. See details. 
}
}

\details{
\code{fit_t_env_ou} allows fitting OU-environmental models of trait evolution (Troyer et al. 2020, Goswami & Clavel 2024). Compared to model implemented in \code{fit_t_env} where the rate of phenotypic evolution evolves as a function of an environmental variable (Clavel & Morlon 2020), here it's the optimum of a generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (also called Hull-White model) that can changes as a function of an environmental variable T(t). More formally, the model is defined by the following process:

\deqn{dX(t)  =  \alpha  (\theta(t) -X(t))dt + \sigma dB(t)}{dX(t) = alpha*(theta(t) - X(t))dt + sigma*dB(t) }

Note that this model works only on NON-ULTRAMETRIC trees (e.g., with fossils)


The default model has the optimum changing as a function of environmental changes though times as 
defined below:

\deqn{\theta (t)  =  \theta_0 + \beta T(t)}{theta(t) = theta_0 + beta * T(t)}

Users defined models should have the following form (see also examples below):

\code{fun <- function(t, env, param, theta0){ theta0 + param*env(t)}}

\emph{t}: is the time parameter.

\emph{env}: is a time function of an environmental variable. 
See for instance object created by \code{splinefun} when interpolating coordinate of points.

\emph{param}: is a vector of parameters to estimate.

\emph{theta_0}: is the state at the root of the tree.

For instance, the default model function can be coded as: 

\code{fun <- function(t, env, param, theta0){ theta0 + param[1]*env(t)}} 

where \code{param[1]} is the \eqn{\beta} parameter. 
Note that in this case, one starting value should be provided in the \code{param} 
argument.

e.g.:

\code{beta=0}

\code{fit_t_env(tree, data, env_data=InfTemp, model=fun, param=beta)}



The various options are passed through "...". 

-param: The starting values used for the model. Must match the total number of parameters of the specified models. If "error=NA", a starting value for the SE to be estimated must be provided with user-defined models.

-scale: scale the amplitude of the environmental curve between 0 and 1. This may improve the parameters search in some situations.

-df: the degree of freedom to use for defining the spline. As a default, smooth.spline(env_data[,1], env_data[,2])$df is used. See \emph{sm.spline} for details.

-upper: the upper bound for the parameter search when the "L-BFGS-B" method is used. See \emph{optim} for details.

-lower: the lower bound for the parameter search when the "L-BFGS-B" method is used. See \emph{optim} for details.

-maxdiff: difference in time between tips and present day for phylogenetic trees with no contemporaneous species (default is 0)
}

\note{
	The users defined function is evaluated forward in time i.e.: from the root to the tips (time = 0 at the (present) tips).
	The speed of convergence of the fit might depend on the degree of freedom chosen to define the spline.
