\title{
  Diversification rates through time
}
\description{
  Calculates diversification rates through time from shift.estimates() output.
}
\usage{
  div.rates(phylo, shift.res, combi = 1,
            part = "backbone", backbone.option = "crown.shift")
}

\arguments{
  \item{phylo}{
    an object of type 'phylo' (see ape documentation)
  }
  \item{shift.res}{
    the output resulting from shift.estimates.
  }
  \item{combi}{
    numeric. The combination of shifts defined by its rank in the global comparison.
  }
  \item{part}{
    character. Specifies for which parts of the combination diversification rates has to be calculated. Default is "backbone" and provides only the backbone rate. Can be "all" for all the parts of a combination or "subclades" for subclades only.
  }
  \item{backbone.option}{
  type of the backbone analysis (see backbone.option in shift.estimates for more details):
    \itemize{ 
      \item"stem.shift": rates are calculated from the stem age for subclades.
      \item"crown.shift": rates are calculated from the crown age for subclades.
    }
  }
}

\value{
  a list of matrix with two rows (speciation and extinction) and as many columns as million years from the root to the present.
}
